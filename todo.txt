//TODO - Get Prisma in
Perhaps i might have to redo the client_side first profile part
I need to create a button from shadcn which takes in imageUrl as an icon and renders it
build out servers>layout.tsx then make sure it works to build out the layout properly.
Button discord implementation seems correct, however might need more changes

make button that takes in server img and keeps same animation, maybe i should just reuse the discord one? or not
